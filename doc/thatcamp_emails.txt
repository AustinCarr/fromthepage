THATCamp emails to be sent:

Tom Scheinfelt: link to some good resources on software project management

Travis Brown: hi!

Lisa Spiro: Hi, link, ask for notes, ask about projects that might be interested

Mikal: zoomify or other TS libraries

Adam: YUI WYSIWYG, mention video, and what I'd be interested in using it for

Jeanne: blog, outsider status stuff


Travis, 

It was great talking with you at THATCamp.  eComma looks like a really neat program, as interesting algorithmically as it is beautiful visually.

Thanks for co-demoing at Jeanne's session, and for suffering through a second FromThePage demo at Adam's.

I'd love to see how your projects advance after the summer.  Do keep in touch!

Lisa,

It was great finally meeting you at THATCamp, after stumbling across your Booker Letters work online more than once. 

I'd love to add the results of my search for manuscript transcription tools to the research wiki.  Should I "edit boldly" and let you revise, or wait for a decision on defunct/moribund projects?

I have a favor to ask -- if you were keeping notes during the electronic texts session, would you mind forwarding them to me?  
I'm afraid I found it impossible to record the suggestions people made for FromThePage while I was demoing. 

Speaking of which, I remembered your kind offer to put me in touch with archivists.  Since I'm not exactly trying to sell the software, I'm really only looking for projects that would be a really good fit right now.  If you know of any archivists interested in collaborative tools or volunteer transcriptions, I'd love to talk to them.

Adam,

Have you checked out the Yahoo WYSIWYG yet?  Someone at THATCamp (perhaps Matt Gaventa?) recommended it to me, and at this point I've gotten about halfway through the biker video.  It looks really intriguing so far.
What I'd be interested in implementing would be some customizations of a stripped-down WYSIWYG -- a plugin that would support some TEI features: normalization tags, unclear tags, some image linking, damage tags, and such.  So far I expect that the difficult part will be dealing with the presentation of the new tags within the WYSIWYG, as the toolbar customizations look dead simple.

If you move to a web-based platform, what will you use for printable generation?  There may be another point of intersection between our two systems, as we'll both be trying to present footnotes, marginalia, and such from our internal data structures.  I've used DocBook so far for this, but am unhappy with it and am thinking of generating raw LaTex instead.  That'll be quite a hurdle, however.  If you have any recommendations, or are interested in sharing research or code, please let me know.

THATCamp

I just got back from THATCamp, and man, what a ride!  I've never been to a conference with this level of collaboration before -- neither academic nor technical.  Literally nobody was purely "audience" -- I don't think a single person emerged from the conference without having presented in at least one session, and pitched in their ideas in half a dozen more.

To my astonishment, I ended up demoing FromThePage in two different sessions, and presented a custom how-to on GraphViz in a third.  I was really surprised by the technical savvy of the participants -- just about everyone at the sessions I took part in had done development of one form or another.  The feedback on FromThePage were far more concrete than I was expecting, and got me past several roadblocks:

<ul><li><b>Zoom</b>: I've looked at Zoomify a few times in the past, but have never been able to get around the fact that their image-preparation software is incompatible with Unix-based server-side processing.  Two different people suggested workarounds for this, which may just solve my zoom problems nicely.</li>
<li><b>WYSIWYG</b>: I'd never heard of the Yahoo WYSIWYG before, but a couple of people recommended it as being especially extensible, and appropriate for linking text to subjects.  I've looked over it a bit now, and am really impressed.</li>
<li><b>Analysis</b>: One of the big problems I've had with my graphing algorithm is the noise that comes from mebers of Julia's household.  Because they appear on 99 of 100 entries, they're more related everything, and (worse) show up on relatedness graphs for other subjects as more related than the subjects that's I'm actually looking for.  Over the course of the weekend, while preparing my DorkShorts presentation, discussing it, and explaining the noise quandry in FromThePage, both problem and solution clarified.
The noise is due to the unit of analysis being a single diary entry.  The solution is to reduce the unit of analysis.  Many of the THATCampers suggested alternatives: look for related subjects within the same paragraph, or within N words, or even (using natural language toolkits) within the same sentence.
It might even be possible to do this without requiring markup of each mention of a subject.  One possibility is to automate this by searching the entry text for likely mentions of the same subject that has occurred already.  This search could be informed by previous matches -- the same data I'm using for the autolink feature.  (Inspiration for this comes from Andrea X's description of how Alexander Street Press is using well-encoded texts to inform searches of unencoded texts.)</li>
<li><b>Autolink</b>: Travis Brown, whose background is in computational linguistics, suggested a few basic tools for making autolink smarter.  Namely permuting the morphology of a word before the autolink feature looks for matches.  This would allow me to clean up the matching algorithm, which currently does some gross things with regular expressions to approach the same goal.</li>
<li><b>Workflow</b>: The participants at the Crowdsourcing Transcription and Annotation session were deeply sympathetic to the idea that volunteer-driven projects can't use the same kind of double-keyed, centrally organized workflows that institutional transcription projects use.  They suggested a number of ways to use flagging and ratings to accomplish the same goals.  Rather than assigning transcription to A, identification and markup to B, and proofreading to C, they suggested a user-driven rating system.  This would allow scribes or viewers to indicate the quality level of a transcribed entry, marking it with ratings like "unfinished", "needs review", "pretty good", or "excellent".  I'd add tools to the page list interface to show entries needing review, or ones that were nearly done, to allow volunteers to target the kind of contributions they were making.
Ratings also would provide an non-threating way for novice users to contribute. </li>
<li><b>Mapping</b>: Before the map session, I was manually clicking on Google's MyMaps, then embedding a link within subject articles.  </li>
<li><b>Presentation</b>: The Crowdsourcing session started brainstorming visualization </li>
</ul>

These are all features I'd considered either out-of-reach, dead-ends, or (in one case) entirely impossible.

Thanks to the THATCampers, these doors are open and 
Thanks to THATCamp for letting an uncredentialed amateur working out of his garage attend.  I only hope I gave half as much as I got.

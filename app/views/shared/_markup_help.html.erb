<p>A single carriage-return indicates a line-break in the original document, and will not appear to readers. Two carriage-returns indicate a paragraph, and will appear as a paragraph break to readers. You can use double braces to link subjects. <code>[[Jane Doe]]</code> will link to the subject Jane Doe, while <code>[[Jane Doe|Jane]]</code> will link the text &quot;Jane&quot; to the subject Jane Doe. We recommend that linking be left to an editor after the initial transcription is made.</p>

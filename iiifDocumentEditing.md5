-- Steps to Import a Manuscript from a IIIF Server

* Start at http://www.fromthepage.com
* As a work owner, login 
* Go to 'Start a Project'  (http://www.fromthepage.com/dashboard/startproject)
* Scroll down to "Import from a IIIF Repository"
* 2 choices:  choose a repository from the IIIF Universe listing OR input a manifest ID directly.
* Choose a collection the work should be part of -- collections are how different manuscripts ("works") are grouped together in FromThePage.
* Import

Go to the work.  Here you & your collaborators can transcribe, translate (if enabled), or comment on the pages in the work.  The images you work with here are being "passed through" from the original institution -- they are not copied into FromThePage.


-- Steps to Export via the FromThePage IIIF Server

* Go to http://www.fromthepage.com/iiif/collections
* Search for & show your collection (highlight).  Any public work in FromThePage can be exported as IIIF.
* Search for your work
* Find and Copy the manifest ID
* Open a IIIF Viewer (i.e. Mirador)
* Load your manifest ID
* Choose a page
* Use the viewer to show annotations (In Mirador, use "toggle annotations")
